# cafelle-light README

Hello! This is my first GitHub commit and push! It is for a 
VSCode light color theme titled, Cafelle. I will say that it
is a light theme, however it is more of a mix between dark and
light. It uses many tan and teal or aqua colors.

## Working with Markdown

You can author your README using Visual Studio Code. Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux).
* Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.
